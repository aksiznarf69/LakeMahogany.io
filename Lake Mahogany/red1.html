<i>Corner of 34th and Ryker Ave, the Barbershop with the Busted "Open" Sign and the Horns in the Window, 
	by Theo Feehan-Peters</i><br>&nbsp;God walks into my office in a pinstriped suit and a monochrome filter and a hat that just barely covers his eyes, hands me a tommygun, and says “This one’s gotta go, Sam.”

<br>
&nbsp;But I don’t use the tommygun, save for the two shots planted squarely in his kneecaps in case I fuck up, which I rarely do.

<br>
&nbsp;Anyway, I don’t use the gun. I use words he likes and books he’s read and quotes from his mother and memories of when he was late for dinner. And the nights he cried after he did it and the feeling of blood running down his pant leg as he stumbled away from the scene. And the sirens that cut straight through his eardrum. Only one, because the other was listening for footsteps. Lucky me, I got to use those too. 

<br>
&nbsp;And of course I use knives and saws and the usual Bond villain menagerie, but that sounds less pretentious so I don’t talk about it.

<br>
		&nbsp;This guy isn’t my enemy, per se. He slapped around the wrong girl. I didn’t know her, now I never will, but that’s not why I do it. I didn’t have plans to meet her by accident when she cuts me off in a parking space and I walk up to her screaming as she tries to untangle herself from her too-safe-but-not-really bitch-should’ve-bought-a-Mercedes Volvo seat belt until I realize that she’s really fucking hot. I wasn’t planning on knocking her up with a baby named little Jimmy. I wasn’t planning on getting a little too drunk and calling her a bitch until she slapped me and we both slept it off anyway.

<br>
&nbsp;And you can shove it with your armchair psychology, because I wasn’t. I just like being eloquent about things. Humanizes me.

<br>
&nbsp;So I wasn’t planning on meeting her. Don’t even know her name. Still don’t, in fact. All she is to me is a speck of blood on this guy’s shoe he forgot to wash off. But that’s enough. 

<br>
&nbsp;I know this guy could do good. Hell, he was doing good work for us till he pulled this shit. And I recognize that bad people can do good work. Caesar, Jefferson, Napoleon. But the difference between the asshole spilling about 3 different types of bodily fluid onto my carpet right now, which is gonna be an expensive cleanup by the way, thanks fucker, and them, is that I don’t need to walk out of this room with the knowledge that they’ll walk out too, if I don’t do my job.

<br>
&nbsp;“Please Sam. Please. I’ll never do it again, I wasn’t thinking straight,” he gurgles.

<br>
&nbsp;They always say the same shit when they come in here. ‘I wasn’t thinking right’, ’give me another chance.’ Well, you son of a bitch, she doesn’t GET another chance. You stupid fucking bastard. You think that just because you’ve had a varied and interesting fucking shiny childhood that you can do whatever shit you FUCKING want. Poor FUCKING you, right, right, yeah. Poor fucking you. Well I bet she did too. And she would.

<br>
&nbsp;Sometimes I think this job is bad for me. Whenever God walks in here with his pinstriped suit and a wad of cash and some nice euphemism I always think, you’re just like this guy. You see your own plight and no one else’s, but you know that I get off on this, and you use me. Hell, maybe you get off on it too, but that’s different, because you’re not the one doing it.

<br>
&nbsp;But at the end of the day, I still get the body and the cash and the nice fuzzy feeling that I hurt someone who needed hurting. I really fucking love my job. 

<br>
&nbsp;And you can stop with the armchair psychology, because I do.<br><br><b><a name="poetry1"></a>Poetry</b><br>
<i>The Vegetable Apparatus, by Ridley Davis</i><br>

You became a carrot.<br>
This was not a successful<br>
venture.  You were a carrot for a mere three minutes before<br>
a stick of celery went rogue and devoured<br>
you whole.  Soon after being digested,<br>
your spirit underwent a series of religious conversions, from<br> 
Catholic to Protestant to a non-profit faith named Loaf, which<br>
was based upon the principle that God<br>
was a French baguette with a crack<br>
in the side.  You were a disciple for all of three years before learning<br>
that Loaf was not in fact a non-profit but rather<br>
a pyramid scheme run by the ghost<br>
of Karl Marx.  Oh dear, you said.<br>
Oh dear.
