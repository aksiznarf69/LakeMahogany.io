A little known fact about sentient paint chips: they like their art down-to-earth, sardonic, and surreal.  They dislike pretense, purple prose, and imagery that serves no other purpose than to boost the authorâ€™s ego.  Keep that in mind when submitting to any of these categories:<br>
<br>
Fiction: Send your finest prose to lakemahoganylitmag@gmail.com with the subject 'Fiction Submission.'  We have a soft spot for flash, but will take anything with a length of under 6,000 words. You may send up to three stories a month. <br>
<br>Poetry: Send your strangest poetry to lakemahoganylitmag@gmail.com with the subject 'Poetry Submission.'  We do not, as yet, have a word limit for verse; all we ask is that you have some measure of self-awareness and refrain from bombarding us with a 3,000 page epic written solely in a blend of haikus and sonnets. You may send up to six poems a month.<br><br>Visual Art: Send your lovely creations to lakemahoganylitmag@gmail.com with the subject 'Visual Art Submission.' Send as many as you like; paint chips are, shockingly enough, quite enamored with visual art due to its embrace of a multitude of colors.
