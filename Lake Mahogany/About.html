	<div class="Mochamint">The founder of this literary magazine was kidnapped by a tyrannical paint chip named Mocha Mint and forced to design this website.  Initially, Mocha Mint had planned to conquer the galaxy, but she recently discovered a passion for surrealist art and has instead settled on taking over the literary world.  To appease Mocha Mint, we strongly recommend you check out our issues—if she does not garner enough views per month, she may once more return to her former plan and attack the White House with her army of off-white paint chips.
    Each issue is written on the paint chips at the bottom of our home page—click on them to see!—and is compiled only of works that embody the particular color of the paint chips they are published on (we have a dedicated workforce of wooden door knobs that go through every submission and analyze them before assigning each a color).
